This is a TensorFlow 2.x implementation of the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) proposed by Gilmer et al. in their paper ["Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry" (2017)](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1704.01212v2)
There are two files in this project. The _model_func.py is the python file containing the model components and the overall model architechture. The _model_func_api.py imports and calls the classes and functions and implements the model. 

This implementation is incomplete. All suggestions are welcome! :)
